## Instal

### Either build:

First time installation:

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/).
1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 6).
1. Install [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (*not* version 3).
1. Navigate to your RES folder.
1. Run `npm install`.

#### Building for Safari

**`npm run build -- safari`** will clean `dist/`, then build RES (release mode).

Jump to **Installing extension**

### If you trust me and want to install directly:

##### Installing extension
  1. Open the `Preferences` by going to `Safari->Preferences` or pressing `âŒ˜,`, then go to `Advanced` and check the checkbox for `Show Develop menu in menu bar`.
  2. Navigate to `Develop->Show Extension Builder` to open the extensions builder. Add a new extension by pressing the `+` in the bottom left and choosing `Add Extension`.
  3. a. Navigate to the `/dist/RES.safariextension` folder (not the `/safari` folder) for RES and select it. (**if you manually build**)
  3. b.  Navigate to the `/Releases/*Release number*/RES.safariextension` folder (not the `/safari` folder) for RES and select it. (**if you manually build**)
  4. If you are using Safari 9+, you should be able to install the extension without enrolling in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/); however, the extension will be auto-uninstalled when you quit Safari.
